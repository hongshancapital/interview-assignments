Usage:

Python Script:

PowerShell Script:
Put the interview_data_set file and script in the same directory.
In my Windows, I put them in the D:\Desktop directory. then

PS D:\Desktop> .\interview.ps1 .\interview_data_set

Due to the https://foo.com/bar URL is a example. these
script will fail to POST the JSON.
I have test in my environment,if the URL is a real one, the scripts will work fine.
