"description":"Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. And now, we’ve been named one of Apple’s 2021 Apps of the Year for connection.Creating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.DATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKINGBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.Bumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAMEAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.THE BUZZ IS REAL“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)---Bumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).We offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.Your personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:https://www.bumble.com/privacyhttps://www.bumble.com/terms", "artistId":1120675060, "artistName":"Bumble Holding Limited", "genres":["Lifestyle", "Social Networking"], "price":0.00, "version":"5.250.0", "wrapperType":"software", "userRatingCount":1025710},

"description":"Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.FAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.SYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.UNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. SECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. 100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. POWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.RELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. FUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.SIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.PRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.For those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.We keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.", "artistId":686450210, "artistName":"Telegram FZ-LLC", "genres":["Social Networking", "Productivity"], "price":0.00, "version":"8.5.1", "wrapperType":"software", "userRatingCount":136601},
